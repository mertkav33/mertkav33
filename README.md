I'm Mert Kavasoğlu, a final-year Computer Engineering student with a strong passion for full-stack development. I specialize in creating user-friendly and responsive web applications using modern frontend technologies like React, as well as backend tools such as Node.js and Python.

In addition to my experience with full-stack JavaScript, I have a solid foundation in C and C++, which strengthens my problem-solving abilities and low-level programming skills. I also work with SQL to design and query relational databases effectively.

Currently, I’m focused on deepening my backend development knowledge and exploring how to build scalable and maintainable systems. I enjoy transforming ideas into working software and continuously seek to apply my skills in real-world projects.
